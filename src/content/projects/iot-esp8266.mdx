# Description

A simple circuit and code to connect the ESP8266 and DHT22 sensors together, to connect it to the internet, and to send data from the IoT device to a database hosted on my VPS running on Docker to keep and process that data and to be able to fetch it from the database to show on a [dashboard](/projects/iot-dashboard).
