# Introduction

This blog is a continuation of my previous blog post, [An Experience Being an Intern at a Tech Company (Part 1)](/blog/first-month-internship-review/). It had been a long-awaited blog, but I was too busy with work to write it. But now, I have some free time to write it. So let's get started.

# Recap

In the previous blog, I talked about how I got the internship and what I did in the first month. I also detailed my daily routine at the company. If you haven't read it yet, I recommend you read it.

# What I've learned

In the two months of my internship, I've learned a lot of things. I've learned how a software company works and the process of developing software as a team. I've also learned how to use stuff like Helm and Tilt for DevOps and new frameworks like Svelte. I've also learned how to use Ory Hydra for authentication.

## Svelte

This part is dedicated to Svelte. Svelte is a new framework that I've never used before. It differs slightly from the React framework I was previously familiar with. At first it seemed a bit hard because I had never used it before, but once I got the hang of it, it was quite easy to use. I've learned how to use Svelte's stores, actions, and other glorious features.

From my experience, Svelte is a fantastic framework to start your coding journey. The learning curve is very low, and the coding patterns are straightforward to understand. After having this internship, I've used SvelteKit to build some of my projects.

## Ory Hydra

Ory Hydra is an open-source software that takes care of authentication. It was a bit challenging to understand at first, but after a few days of working with it, I got the hang of it. I've learned how to utilize the "flows" of each authentication method. At first, it was a bit of a hassle, but nothing is impossible if you put in the effort. Their documentation is very good, and that helped ease the learning process.

## UI Library

While working at the company, one of my jobs was to migrate the UI library, which included implementing new components and updating the old ones. This taught me how to create a design library and how to implement it in the application. I've used TailwindCSS for the style.

# Conclusion

I would like to thank API Plus Tech for giving me this opportunity to work with them. I've learned a lot of things that I wouldn't have learned if I hadn't joined them. I'm glad that I was once a part of this company. Thank you for reading my blog. See you later.
