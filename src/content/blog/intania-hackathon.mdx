# My Intania Hackathon Experience

## The Beginning: Diving into the Unknown

When I first signed up for the Intania Hackathon, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. With just 48 hours to ideate, build, and present a solution, our team of five was both excited and nervous about the journey ahead.

## The Team

I was fortunate to team up with four other talented individuals:

- [Nick](https://github.com/pineylilly)
- [Ten](https://github.com/Tenkris)
- [V](https://github.com/hellp002)
- [Win](https://github.com/WinSukon)

Our team name was **ChadGPT**

## The Problem

We were given this problem

> How might you craft a solution that blends the
> excitement of gaming with the benefits of
> education, making learning fun and interactive while
> sparking creativity, encouraging self-discovery, and
> supporting ongoing skill development?

## The Solution

We spent the first hour brainstorming ideas. After much discussion, we decided to create a mathematical game that would help students learn math in a fun and engaging way. Our solution, Realms of Math, is a gamified learning platform that allows students to practice math through interactive challenges and rewards.

### The Tech Stack

Because we had limited time, we chose technologies that we were already familiar with. This decision allowed us to focus on building a functional prototype rather than getting bogged down in learning new tools.

We decided to use:

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: FastAPI (Hosted on AWS EC2)
- Database: AWS DynamoDB
- Additional tools: Minio S3 (Self-Hosted by me)

## The Challenges

No hackathon would be complete without its share of challenges. Some of the biggest hurdles we faced included:

1. **Time Constraints**: With only 48 hours, we had to make quick decisions about scope and features.
2. **Technical Issues**: React's state management can be tricky, and we spent a lot of time debugging issues that arose from state updates.

## The Breakthrough Moment

Around the midpoint of the hackathon, we had a working prototype that was playable. The outcome was a huge morale boost for the team. We then met to discuss our progress and what needed to be done before the final presentation. We divided tasks based on each member’s strengths, which helped us work more efficiently.

## A Little Bit of Fun

During the Hackathon, there was also a side event, **Bits Battle.** There were 3 routes of challenges: CSS, CTF, and Design. I chose the CTF route because I wanted to test my skills. It was a fun way to take a break from the main project. We were the only team to have solved all the challenges in the CTF route.

## The Final Stretch

On the day that we had to submit our project, we were all feeling the pressure. We had a few last-minute bugs to fix and some features to polish. Finally, we submitted our project just minutes before the deadline.

## The Presentation Day

We didn’t even know that we had to present our project; it was due to the hackathon rules that only 6 teams would be selected to present their projects.

We were one of the lucky teams that got selected to present our project.

This is how our project looked during the presentation:

## The Results

Even though we didn’t win the top 3 prizes, we won the “Best Of Technical prize, and we also received positive feedback from the judges and other participants. They appreciated our innovative approach to gamifying education and the potential impact of our solution.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Teamwork Under Pressure**: I discovered the importance of clear communication when time is limited.
2. **MVP Mindset**: Understanding how to prioritize features to create a working minimum viable product.
3. **Networking**: Beyond the competition, I connected with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.
4. **Business Skills**: I learned how to pitch an idea effectively, which is crucial for any developer looking to make an impact.

## Honorable Mentions
