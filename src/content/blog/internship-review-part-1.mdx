# Introduction

In this blog, I'll tell you about the internship experience that I'm currently having. What company did I join, what was the process that I went through, and what work am I doing at the company.

# How did I get here

As an Electrical Engineering student in Chulalongkorn, we must take an internship, preferably in the summer session, before entering the senior year (Year 4). So I did. Finding work was a bit hard in a competitive environment like this because Chula wants you to have an internship of around 2 months, but most companies in the engineering industry demand at least 3 months. And most companies in the electrical engineering field don't even have an internship program.

But one day, while exploring the Computer Programming Job Fair on Discord (it's very convenient this way, I think), I stumbled upon a tech company. I then sent them my resume, thinking that it would just be like other places that I applied for, not even an answer, but no, it wasn't like that. A couple hours passed by and an employer called me, saying that they were interested. Without hesitation, I said yes and scheduled an interview session.

I went to the company to have the interview. I met the CEO and a bunch of other people in the office. It was very nice to meet most of the team due to it being a WFH day that day, so not all teams were in. They gave me an assignment to do, and I was accepted. That day was very nice, knowing that someone saw my potential and picked me up. That company was [API Plus Tech](https://apiplustech.com/).

# First Day at Work

The first day that I went to work, it was nice. Since I had already met like half of the employees, it wasn't that new to me, so I felt right in. The first day was mostly about setting things up and getting to know each member of each team. The company is divided into two teams, physically separated by two floors. The first team on the first floor is the UX/UI team. They make the UI and Design Library for developers to implement. The second team on the second floor is the dev team, which consists of front-end, back-end, and devOps. I'm on the front-end team.

# Working Experience

I was assigned to migrate the applications from the old design library to the new one. The first few days were quite hard because it was new to me since I didn't have that much experience with Svelte. But when I got used to it, it was smooth sailing after that. Every Tuesday and Thursday, we will have a meeting to update our work and discuss any problems that we have.

In the past month, I've learned a lot of things, not only about the development part but also how a company works together because I've always worked on my own. This is like the first time I'm fully utilizing Git to collaborate with my teammates. I've also learned a lot about Ory Hydra, an open-source software that takes care of authentication. It was a bit of a hassle at the start, but nothing is hard if you try harder. I got to learn the "flows" of each method in authentication. I also got to workout a lot because when there is a question about the UI that seems odd, I have to walk downstairs and ask them and come back up. It's nice to have some exercise and not just sit down and code all day.

# A day of an Tech Intern

Here is a typical day's schedule

- 8:30
  - Drive to work
- 9:30
  - Enter the Office
- 9:30 - 12:30
  - Work Work Work
- 12:30 - 13:30
  - Lunch Time
  - Make a cup of coffee
    - There is a espresso press in the office with coffee beans for you to enjoy creating your cup of coffee

That's basically a day of work. For me, the work is not that hard, and a day at work is fun. I get to do what I love doingâ€”learning new things and also getting paid.

# Conclusion

That's my experience of being an intern for one month. Next month, I'll come back and update the full 2-month internship. Thank you for sticking to the end. See you later.
