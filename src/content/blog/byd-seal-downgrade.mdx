# Introduction
In this tutorial I will show you how to downgrade BYD Seal from V1.1 (2310) to V1 (2307). This will bring back the ability to install apps in the car's screen.

## Requirements
1. A USB drive with at least 8GB of storage.
2. A computer with internet access.
3. Firmware file.
4. Around 1 hour of your time.

# Let's get started
First, we need to download the firmware file. You can download it from [here](https://cdn.jjus.dev/Di3.0_13.1.33.2307210.1.18.3.2.2307190.2.zip).

Once you have downloaded the file. Rename it to <span class='underline'>UpdateFull.zip</span> and copy it to the root of the USB drive.
