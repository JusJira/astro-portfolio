## Introduction
In this tutorial I will show you how to downgrade BYD Seal from V1.1 (2310) to V1 (2307). This will bring back the ability to install apps in the car's screen.

<h3 class='text-red-600'>Warning</h3>
<p class='dark:text-red-400 text-red-600'>This process might brick your car's screen. Do it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this process.</p>

## Requirements
1. A USB drive with at least 8GB of storage.
2. A computer with internet access.
3. Firmware file.
4. Around 1 hour of your time.

## Let's get started

First, we need to download the firmware file. You can download it from [here](https://cdn.jjus.dev/UpdateFull.zip).

Once you have downloaded the file. Rename it to <span class='underline'>UpdateFull.zip</span>.
Now plug in your USB drive and format it to FAT32 or exFAT, inside it create a folder named BYDUpdatePackage and go inside it and create another folder named msm8953_64 and then copy the <span class='underline'>UpdateFull.zip</span> file inside the msm8953_64 folder.

Make sure the file structure looks like this:

- BYDUpdatePackage
  - msm8953_64
    - UpdateFull.zip

## Downgrading

Now that we have the USB drive ready, we can start the downgrade process.Go in your car and plug in the USB drive in the USB port.

If you have put the file in correctly you should see a pop up in the car saying
that you can downgrade. Click on the pop up and the car will start the downgrade
process.
